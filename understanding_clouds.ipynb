    "The challenge is to segment satellite images into one of four classes: Sugar, Flower, Fish and Gravel. These clouds look benign compared to big thunderstorms but, in fact, for the Earth’s climate they play a huge role. The reason is that they reflect a lot of sunlight back into space, thereby cooling our planet, while only contributing marginally to the greenhouse effect. This means that it’s really important to figure out how these clouds will change as our planet warms."
